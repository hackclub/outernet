## Lightning Talk

Why you should start an open-source project

### Plan

I work in several open-source projects, and I've found them to be extremely beneficial to my growth as a developer. I'd like to talk about my experience working in the space, and why others should also do such.

I'll have a few slides in my project listing some of the projects I've worked on, as well as bullet-points of key information I'd like the audience to remember.
