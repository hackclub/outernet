## Sprig for Beginners

### Plan (Tentative)

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)
I'll be running a workshop on how to make a basic Sokoban game! It'll follow the tutorial laid out in the Sprig batch jam (in progress).

> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)
I'm working on the Sprig batch jam & have taught sprig in a club! I'll be using something similar to [this tutorial](https://sprig-tutorial-sam.vercel.app/gallery/getting_started)

#### Outline

1. I give an introduction to Sprig and Javascript; basics & why it matters
2. Have people open Sprig on their computers; run through the tutorial
3. Finish the workshop. Celebrate!


### Do you think you might need anything?
Everyone needs computers, internet (unless we host a copy of Sprig locally), whiteboard and/or projector!

### People involved
> Just me!
