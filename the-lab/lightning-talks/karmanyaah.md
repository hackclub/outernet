## Lightning Talk

### Plan


UnifiedPush is an open-source push notification protocol alternative to FCM from Google. It's primarily targeted at de-Googled Android, but there is some interest by KDE to make a Mobile Linux system as well. Being distributed means that it can be self-hosted. 

- I'll show a diagram of how all the different components integrate (preferably on slides but can be done on whiteboard as well)
- If I have a projector, I'll show a screen capture on how it practically works
- Explain the privacy implications of centralized push notification systems
- If I have time in the end, I'll show my work on a protocol-conversion proxy.

This is an article I wrote about it: <https://f-droid.org/en/2022/12/18/unifiedpush.html>
