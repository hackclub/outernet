## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

My talk is going to be about why making things is so important in education.
I'll start the talk with a story from my life, and transition into why I think that a lack of making things is one of the biggest issues in our schools right now.
I'll conclude with what I plan to do in the upcoming school year and a quote from a Hack Club alum.
I will have slides and need a projector.
