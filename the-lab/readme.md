# 🧪 The Lab
[Want to add your submit your lighting talk or workshop](https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/tree/guild-channels/the-lab/experiments)

Home to workshops & lighting talks at Outernet!

Imagine a place where you can learn something new, and come out with something of your own? Something technical or nerdy like your own programming language, or maybe your very own canvas of art or even a restored Mac. There's no limit to what a workshop or lighting talk can be (as long as it's legal :p), the only limit is your imagination!

The Lab isn't like your typical hackathon or event workshop, it's a space for you to learn, host, or create an experiment (a workshop, lighting talk, or both!) .  At the end of the day, we want it to be **open to you!**. This means that we're not going to have a typical schedule, or requirements. We're not handpicking workshops or talks (to an extent) and only having those, we're working with every idea and polishing it until it's perfect. We'll have some slots open where anyone can sign up during the event, we'll keep the space open (even in off-hours), and try to help you get what you need.

This is the lab, come help us make it special
